	<h4>Recover Lost Profit, Reduce Collection Costs</h4>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
			<p>Managing receivables is often the last item on the "to do" list, but neglect of timely follow-up on past due accounts is one of the biggest factors in out-of-control receivables. Instead of waiting until an account is uncollectible and turning it over to a costly traditional collection agency, why not try a proactive solution?</p>
			<p>With QuickCollect, we target a past due account before it gets deep into the "debt spiral". We use a time-tested, automated recovery process that gently engages with your indebted clients before a more direct approach is required. That means you recover more accounts, more quickly, and with much less risk to your valuable client relationships.</p>
			<p>You maintain complete control of the process with detailed daily reporting through the web-based QuickCollect system, and direct contact once your client initiates repayment. Preserve your customers' goodwill and reclaim the profit that is rightfully yours.</p>
